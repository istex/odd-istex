            <p>In order to assess the prognostic value of silent myocardial ischemia in acute myocardial infarction after thrombolysis and early coronary angiography (14–48 h
                    after start of thrombolysis) including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, if indicated, 126 patients underwent 24 h-Holter-monitoring in the early postinfarction
                    period. The 24 h-Holter-recording was initiated directly after early coronary intervention (40±11 h after onset of symptoms). Of the 126 patients initially eligible for the
                    study 29 had to be excluded from further analysis for clinical or methodical reasons. Of the remaining 97 patients, 10 (10%) had silent ischemia (group A) and 87/97 (90%) patients
                    showed no significant ST-segment alterations. Both groups did not significantly differ from each other with regard to baseline clinical characteristics, severity of coronary artery
                    disease and frequency of successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The left ventricular ejection fraction showed a trend towards lower values in patients with than
                    in those without silent ischemia (47±15% vs. 55±13%, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>=0.07). When both silent ischemia and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% were
                    present, a subset of patients at high risk for cardiac death could be identified (specificity: 98%, positive predictive accuracy: 75%). By Kaplan–Meier analysis,
                    significantly more cardiac deaths occurred in group A than in group B (30% vs. 6%, <hi rend="italic">p</hi>&lt;0.01) during the three-year follow-up (950±392 days) after
                    acute myocardial infarction. Regarding the cardiac events during long-term follow-up (emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting,
                    non-fatal reinfarction, and cardiac death) there was no significant difference between both groups (30% vs. 18%, NS). In conclusion, Holter monitor-detected silent ischemia in the
                    subacute phase of myocardial infarctionI after thrombolysis followed by early delayed coronary intervention occurs in 10% of the patients indicating either a residual ischemia in
                    the infarcted zone despite a combined reperfusion strategy or a remote ischemic potential in case of multivessel disease. In this small selected group of infarct patients too,
                    silent ischemia is to be considered as an important non-invasive parameter to predict cardiac death during long-term follow-up and provides valuable complementary information to
                    left ventricular dysfunction, a well established prognostic marker in the postinfarction period.</p>

               <head>Introduction</head>
               <p>Transient silent myocardial ischemia is a frequent and important prognostic phenomenon in coronary heart disease. Many studies have shown that occurrence of unfavourable
                    myocardial events in patients with a stable <ref target="#BIB1 #BIB2 #BIB3">[1–3]</ref> or unstable angina pectoris <ref target="#BIB4 #BIB5 #BIB6 #BIB7">[4–7]</ref> was significantly correlated with the presence of silent ischemia.</p>
               <p>Many of the studies conducted to date, evaluating the clinical value of silent ischemiaafter an acute myocardial infarction, stem from either the pre-thrombolytic era
                        <ref target="#BIB8 #BIB9 #BIB10 #BIB11">[8–11]</ref> or included only those patients that were treated in a conservative manner <ref target="#BIB12">[12]</ref>. More recent studies have evaluated both the conventionally treated patients as well as those receiving thrombolytic therapy <ref target="#BIB13 #BIB14 #BIB15 #BIB16 #BIB17 #BIB18">[13–18]</ref>. Furthermore only a few studies have been carried out on infarct patients who underwent exclusively
                    thrombolytic treatment thereby considering influence of thrombolysis on the incidence of silent ischemia after myocardial infarction <ref target="#BIB19 #BIB20">[19,20]</ref>. This question is of particular importance from the point of view of reocclusion after thrombolysis <ref target="#BIB21">[21]</ref>.
                    The available data are variable and in part controversial due to the heterogeneous collection of patients studied.</p>
               <p>The objective of the present study was to investigate, if silent ischemia detected by 24 h-Holter-monitoring in patients, who all had received thrombolytic therapy for acute
                    myocardial infarction or thrombolysis and additional delayed early percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the infarct-related artery if indicated, gave evidence of
                    predictive value in terms of in-hospital and long-term outcome.</p>

                  <head>Study population</head>
                  <p>Between March 1990, and January 1992, 126 consecutive patients were included in the study (18&lt;age&lt;75 years). The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1). a
                        working preliminary diagnosis of ‘‘acute myocardial infarction” based on history of clinical symptoms and ≥0.1 mV ST elevation in at least one
                        standard or two precordial electrocardiogram (ECG) leads, (2) admission to intensive care unit within 4 h of onset of symptoms and (3) lack of contraindications for
                        thrombolytic therapy.</p>
                  <p>A myocardial infarction was considered as definite when the level of serum creatine kinase in two successive measurements was more than 25% over the upper limit of the
                        normal range of the admitting hospital and both clinical symptoms and ECG recordings pointed to an acute myocardial infarction as described previously <ref target="#BIB22">[22]</ref>. If the creatine kinase elevations did not occur, patients were excluded from the study.</p>
                  <p>The here described investigation was carried out as substudy of a randomized prospective multi-hospital study, termed Southwest German Interventional Study in Acute
                        Myocardial Infarction (SIAM), Part II <ref target="#BIB22">[22]</ref>, in which 14 hospitals participated. In this investigation the enrolled patients were
                        grouped according to the study protocol, in order to compare a conservative with an invasive strategy after thrombolysis with anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen
                        streptokinase activator complex) in acute myocardial infarction <ref target="#BIB22 #BIB23">[22,23]</ref>. The conservative strategy consisted of no coronary
                        angiography or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty during the first 21 days, with coronary angiography performed only before discharge. The patient cohort we
                        analyzed represented the patients of the “invasive group“ who were transferred to our hospital and underwent early coronary angiography including percutaneous
                        transluminal coronary angioplasty, if indicated, as well as pre-discharge angiography as control.</p>

                  <head>Therapeutic regimen of acute myocardial infarction</head>
                  <p>All patients received a standard regimen as follows: anistreplase (30 mg over 5 min) in the primary hospitals within 4 h of admission. Heparin i.v. was administered 2 h
                        after onset of thrombolytic therapy, increasing the partial thromboplastin time to between 60 and 80 s. Supplementary treatment with nitroglycerine i.v. was also recommended.
                        The prophylactic use of β-blocker, calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was not generally applied, but individually considered.</p>

               <head>Discussion</head>
               <p>Recurrent myocardial ischemia, either silent or symptomatic, early after acute myocardial infarction in patients all treated by thrombolysis is associated with an increased
                    risk of unfavourable cardiac events <ref target="#BIB19 #BIB20">[19,20]</ref>. However, the incidence and predictive value of silent ischemia after thrombolysis
                    and early interventional therapy has not been investigated yet. In the present study, we have demonstrated in a small selected group of young infarct patients, by means of 24
                    h-Holter-ECGs performed during the early postinfarction period, that silent ischemia was even present after thrombolysis and early delayed percutaneous transluminal coronary
                    angiopalsty in 10% of patients indicating either a residual ischemia in the infarcted zone despite a combined reperfusion therapy or a remote ischemic potential in 5/10 patients
                    (50%) with 2 or 3-vessel disease, as Stevenson et al. <ref target="#BIB27">[27]</ref> recently discussed in infarct patients treated by thrombolysis. Further, by
                    Kaplan Meier analysis, silent ischemia was significantly associated with cardiac death during the in-hospital phase and the 3-year follow-up.</p>
               <div n="4.1">
                  <head>Incidence</head>
                  <p>The relatively low incidence of 10% for silent ischemia in our study lies almost at the lower boundaries, when compared to other reports in which myocardial ischemia
                        following myocardial infarction is described in 8 to 46% of the patients <ref target="#BIB8 #BIB9 #BIB10 #BIB11 #BIB12 #BIB13 #BIB14 #BIB15 #BIB16 #BIB17 #BIB18 #BIB19 #BIB20">[8–20]</ref>. This may be attributed to the following factors: (1) standard thrombolytic therapy and early delayed percutaneous transluminal coronary
                        angioplasty of the infarct vessel, if indicated, in relatively young patients (mean age 57±10, range 21–75 years), to minimize the risk of ischemia after
                        myocardial infarction, (2) early start of 24 h-Holter-monitoring (40±11 h after onset of symptoms), and (3) taking into consideration only silent ST-episodes for further
                        analysis in this study. Furthermore, the patients were sedated and in bed during the total observation time for SI. Often silent ST-episodes are provoked by silent increases in
                        heart rate and blood pressure which were likely reduced by the type of therapy these patients received.</p>
                  <p>In the collectives by Silva et al. <ref target="#BIB19">[19]</ref> and Stevenson et al. <ref target="#BIB20">[20]</ref> who describe
                        Holter-detected ST-episodes after acute mycardial infarction in 8 or 41%, respectively, a thrombolytic therapy was received by all the patients, although the distribution of
                        the thrombolytic agents streptokinase and alteplase was dissimilar in the 2 studies. Other authors <ref target="#BIB9 #BIB10 #BIB11">[9–11]</ref> either
                        make no comments regarding thrombolytic treatment or have not included patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy <ref target="#BIB12">[12]</ref>. In many of the
                        current reports the proportion of patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy ranged from 18 to 78% <ref target="#BIB13 #BIB15 #BIB16 #BIB17 #BIB18">[13,15–18]</ref>. Surprisingly, there was no evidence of any significant relation between the thrombolytic therapy and the occurence of transient
                        myocardial ischemia.</p>
                  <p>We chose to record silent so early after acute myocardial infarction in order to identify those asymptomatic patients particularly at risk, so that prompt invasive
                        diagnostics and treatment could be undertaken <ref target="#BIB28">[28]</ref>. According to the results from Currie et al. <ref target="#BIB9">[9]</ref>, silent ischemia early after myocardial infarction is prognostically more significant, although its presence in the subacute phase of myocardial
                        infarction is less frequent than in the subsequent weeks.</p>
                  <p>Like other investigators <ref target="#BIB12 #BIB15 #BIB16 #BIB18 #BIB19">[12,15,16,18,19]</ref>, we could not find any significant correlation between the
                        occurrence of early transient myocardial ischemia on Holter-monitoring and clinical baseline characteristics, including the history and the location and size of myocardial
                        infarction. Our data showed that, after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, there were more patients with 3-vessel disease (30% vs. 8%) and less with
                        0-vessel disease (diameter reduction &lt;50%; 10% vs. 30%) in the group with silent ischemia. However, these differences were not significant because of the small sample

                        found a significant relationship between the incidence of transient myocardial ischemia and the higher frequency of multi-vessel disease <ref target="#BIB12 #BIB19">[12,19]</ref> or the slighter occurrence of an 0/1-vessel disease <ref target="#BIB19">[19]</ref>, respectively.</p>
                  <p>We did not find any difference in silent ischemia between the patients with and those without percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, which could not be expected
                        according to the study protocol, since the decision to perform a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was not based on randomization, but on the presence of a
                        diameter reduction in the infarct-related artery of ≥70% with appropriate morphology and location. Thus, it was not possible to investigate the influence of early
                        interventional revascularization following thrombolysis on silent ischemia in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction.</p>
                  <p>The left ventricular ejection fraction as assessed by left ventricular angiography showed lower values in group A based on the larger infract size and the higher rate of
                        previous myocardial infarction, without however achieving statistical significance (<hi rend="italic">p</hi>=0.07) due to the small number of the patients. Many other authors
                            <ref target="#BIB12 #BIB14 #BIB15 #BIB16 #BIB19">[12,14–16,19]</ref> found no significant differences in the value for left ventricular ejection
                        fraction either between patients with and those without transient myocardial ischemia.</p>

                  <p>The observation that 40% of the patients with SI also had a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% is in good agreement with experimental data concerning the
                        consequences of prolonged myocardial ischemia on left ventricular function. A relationship between recurring ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction is exhibited in the form
                        of a so-called “stunned myocardium” <ref target="#BIB29">[29]</ref>. Moreover, the work of Langer et al. <ref target="#BIB15">[15]</ref> also underlines that a significant improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction within 9 days following myocardial infarction has been seen in
                        patients without silent ischemia in the first postinfarction week, in comparison to those patients with silent ischemia indicating that the presence of transient ischemia after
                        acute myocardial infarction represents a prognostic factor for the recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction.</p>

                  <head>In-hospital phase</head>
                  <p>Our data show a higher rate of cardiac mortality in group A, though only one patient died in group A and 1 in group B. Due to this low event rate, the cardiac mortality of
                        patients with and without silent ischemia during hospitalization needs to be evaluated with caution. There appears to be no significant difference in the number of non-fatal
                        reinfarctions, emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties/coronary artery bypass graftings, and all cardiac events together between the two patient groups
                        during the in-hospital phase.</p>
                  <p>The results from other investigators are controversial with regard to the in-hospital phase: Silva et al. <ref target="#BIB19">[19]</ref> observed a
                        significantly higher risk of reinfarctions and emergency revascularizations when ischemia was present during 24 h-ECG-monitoring, though the rate of mortality and elective
                        revascularization were not thereby affected. Langer and co-workers <ref target="#BIB15">[15]</ref>, on the other hand, could not establish any differences
                        regarding cardiac events during hospitalization.</p>

                  <head>Long-term follow-up</head>
                  <p>In the present study, a cardiac mortality rate of 5% was determined during the 3-year follow-up after discharge for group B, whereas patients in group A showed a fivefold
                        mortality rate (25% vs. 5%). This trend remained constant for group A patients regarding the cardiac mortality (30% vs. 6%) during total observation time (hospitalization and
                        long-term follow-up). Since patients with ST-episodes also had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (<hi rend="italic">p</hi>=0.07), the higher mortality rate in this
                        group has to be reasonably attributed to both early recurrent myocardial ischemia and left ventricular dysfunction. Further, it must be emphasized that the cardiac death was
                        also closely associated with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%, having even a higher sensitivity than the presence of SI, which is in agreement with the
                        established predictive value of a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after myocardial infarction <ref target="#BIB30">[30]</ref>. When both silent
                        ischemia and left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% occur simultaneously, a group at high risk for cardiac death (<hi rend="italic">p</hi>=0.001) can be identified with
                        the highest specificity and positive predictive value. In the prethrombolytic era, Gottlieb and co-workers <ref target="#BIB10">[10]</ref> found in a group of
                        high-risk postinfarction patients (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% and/or Lown ventricular class III or higher) a significant relationship between silent
                        ischemia and an increased 1-year-mortality rate which was independent of left ventricular ejection fraction and the post-mortem coronary findings. Recently, Gill et al.
                            <ref target="#BIB13">[13]</ref> demonstrated that the positive predictive value of transient ischemia for death after myocardial infarction was low (12%)
                        and left ventricular ejection fraction the stronger indicator for death after 1 year, though myocardial ischemia provided important prognostic information for other events such
                        as non-fatal myocardial infarction and unstable angina pectoris.</p>
                  <p>The incidence of non-fatal (non-fatal reinfarctions and emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting) and all cardiac events
                        together (non-fatal reinfarctions, emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting, and cardiac death) were not statistically
                        different between the groups A and B due to the small number of events. Gill and co-workers <ref target="#BIB13">[13]</ref> found a 2.3-to 3-fold rate of
                        non-fatal coronary events and death during a follow-up period over 1 year in postinfarction patients receiving thrombolytic therapy in 55%. Similarly, in two recent studies
                            <ref target="#BIB19 #BIB20">[19,20]</ref> including only infarct patients treated with thrombolytic agents the patients with transient myocardial ischemia
                        in the early post-thrombolysis phase were found to have an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal reinfarctions particularly within the first 30 days after acute myocardial
                        infarction <ref target="#BIB20">[20]</ref> or more in-hospital non-fatal coronary events, respectively <ref target="#BIB19">[19]</ref>. In the
                        former study <ref target="#BIB19">[19]</ref>, a significant decrease in survival without reinfarction and survival without combined cardiac events could be
                        shown by Kaplan Meier analysis during a 6-month follow-up in patients having transient myocardial ischemia early after myocardial infarction.</p>

                  <head>Limitations</head>
                  <p>In comparison to other studies concerning the significance of transient myocardial ischemia after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction <ref target="#BIB19 #BIB20">[19,20]</ref>, both the number of patients and cardiac events in our study are markedly lower, and thus, the clinical significance of the
                        present data is quite limited. Moreover, the patient collective studied consisted of individuals with a relatively low mean age who had early percutaneous transluminal coronary
                        angioplasty performed after acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis, thus selecting out a small low-risk group from the total number of infarct patients. This makes
                        the interpretation of the results difficult and precludes its generalization to all infarct patients. Nevertheless, the findings tend to be in agreement with many previous
                        studies dealing with the prognostic value of silent after acute myocardial from both the pre-thrombolytic and thrombolytic era <ref target="#BIB13 #BIB14 #BIB15 #BIB16 #BIB17 #BIB18 #BIB19 #BIB20">[13–20]</ref>.</p>
                  <p>In summary, our data show that, after acute myocardial infarction treated with thrombolytic therapy followed by early delayed percutaneous transluminal coronary
                        angioplasty, about a tenth of the patients have silent ischemia in the early postinfarction period indicating either a residual ischemia in the infarcted zone despite a
                        combined reperfusion strategy or a remote ischemic potential in case of multivessel disease. These patients showed a tendency towards a lower left ventricular ejection fraction
                        and a higher cardiac mortality than patients without silent ischemia. When both silent ischemia as well as left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% were present, the
                        combination of these two parameters identified a patient group at high risk for cardiac death with a high positive predictive value during a 3-year follow-up.</p>
                  <p>From these results it is concluded that silent ischemia in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction after thrombolysis and early coronary intervention is to be
                        considered as an important non-invasive prognostic parameter taken alone, and when occurring in the presence of a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, provides valuable
                        additional information for long-term prognosis following acute myocardial infarction.</p>

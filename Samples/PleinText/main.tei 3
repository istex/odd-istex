            <p>Acylpeptide hydrolase was purified to homogeneity from porcine intestinal mucosa using a seven-step procedure including ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration
                    as well as anion exchange and affinity chromatography. The specific activity of the enzyme reached 105 000 nmol/mg protein per min and the purification was as high as
                    5500-fold. This tetrameric enzyme is composed of four apparently identical subunits, the molecular mass of which was estimated to be 75 kDa, based on the results of amino acid
                    analysis and gel electrophoresis performed under denaturing conditions. It is likely that the NH<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>-terminal residue may be acetylated, while serine was found to be
                    the COOH-terminal residue. The hydrolytic activity of the enzyme toward <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-acetyl-<hi rend="smallCaps">l</hi>-alanine
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi>-nitroanilide at the optimum pH value was increased twofold in the presence of the chloride anion. The <hi rend="italic">K</hi>
               <hi rend="subscript">m</hi> value
                    calculated from the kinetics of the hydrolysis of acetylalanyl peptides was found to be 0.7±0.1 mM, whereas the <hi rend="italic">V</hi>
               <hi rend="subscript">max</hi> value decreased
                    from 200 to 50 nmol/min per μg of enzyme, depending on the peptidic chain lengths. The <hi rend="italic">V</hi>
               <hi rend="subscript">max</hi> value of the synthetic substrate (250
                    nmol/min per μg of enzyme) was 25–500% higher than those of the acetylalanyl peptides, depending on the peptide chain length, although the enzyme affinity was
                    slightly lower (1.8 mM as compared with 0.7 mM). In line with data on other animal species and on various tissues, the enzyme seemed likely to be a serine protease, since it was
                    readily inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate and diethyl pyrocarbonate. A 2377-nucleotide long cDNA coding for the enzyme was isolated from pig small intestine. The deduced
                    amino acid sequence consisted of 731 residues and showed a single different amino acid with that of the porcine liver APH, except the N-terminal amino acid which is still probably
                    lacking.</p>

               <p>The NH<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>-terminal acetylation of intracellular proteins, which takes place in various eukaryotic cells <ref target="#BIB1 #BIB2">[1,2]</ref>,
                    raises questions about the removal of <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-acetylated residues during the catabolism of intracellular acetylated proteins, as well as that of the acetyl group
                    itself, since free amino acids are necessary to the protein synthesis process. This modification is usually a cotranslational event that occurs when the nascent polypeptide chain
                    is between 20 and 50 residues long <ref target="#BIB3">[3]</ref>, but may also occur during the posttranslational steps of protein biosynthesis.
                        <hi rend="italic">N</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">α</hi>-Acetyltransferase, the major enzyme involved in the acetylation of a variety of NH<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>-terminal residues,
                    catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the α-NH<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> group of proteins and peptides <ref target="#BIB4">[4]</ref>.
                    Although the biological role of <hi rend="italic">N</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">α</hi>-acetylation has not yet been elucidated, it has been suggested that it may be a valuable means of
                    protecting cellular proteins from accidental proteolysis <ref target="#BIB2">[2]</ref> or from possible degradation by the ATP-dependent ubiquitin system
                        <ref target="#BIB5">[5]</ref>, or that it may directly or indirectly affect the processing or sorting of some proteins <ref target="#BIB6 #BIB7">[6,7]</ref>. Moreover, acetylation may also be involved in the activity of some bioactive peptides like melanocyte stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic
                    hormone <ref target="#BIB8 #BIB9">[8,9]</ref>.</p>
               <p>Acylpeptide hydrolase (APH) was first purified from rat liver <ref target="#BIB10">[10]</ref> and found to catalyze the release of the
                    NH<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>-terminal amino acid from acetylated peptides, and consequently to generate shorter peptides with new free NH<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>-terminal residues. A few years
                    later, the enzyme was isolated from bovine and porcine liver <ref target="#BIB11 #BIB12">[11,12]</ref>, rat brain <ref target="#BIB13">[13]</ref>,
                    sheep and human erythrocytes <ref target="#BIB14 #BIB15 #BIB16 #BIB17">[14–17]</ref>, human placenta <ref target="#BIB18">[18]</ref>, rabbit

                        <ref target="#BIB21 #BIB22">[21,22]</ref>. In the rat intestine, however, the enzyme appeared to be different from APH, and has been referred to as the
                        <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-formylmethionine aminopeptidase which cleaves <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-formylMet from di- and tripeptides. The amino acid sequences of the porcine, rat
                    and human liver enzymes have been deduced from the corresponding cDNA sequences <ref target="#BIB23 #BIB24 #BIB25">[23–25]</ref>. In these three cases, APH
                    was found to have a <hi rend="italic">M</hi>
                  <hi rend="subscript">r</hi> of 300 000 and to consist of four identical subunits containing about 730 amino acids each and having a
                        <hi rend="italic">M</hi>
                  <hi rend="subscript">r</hi> of 80 000. The porcine enzyme was identified as a serine protease containing the well known catalytic triad corresponding to
                    Ser 587, His 707 and Asp 675 using site-directed mutagenesis <ref target="#BIB26">[26]</ref>. Although the enzyme was found to have a relatively broad specificity
                    toward short peptide substrates in vitro, it is not very active on proteins.</p>
               <p>The exact biological function of APH is still unknown, since it has yet not been established whether the enzyme is involved in the degradation of
                        <hi rend="italic">N</hi>
                  <hi rend="superscript">α</hi>-acetylated proteins or in the <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-terminal processing events occurring during post- or/and
                    co-translational protein modification. It has also been suggested that the acylpeptide hydrolase may play a role in red cell maturation <ref target="#BIB15 #BIB16">[15,16]</ref>. It might also act as a cell growth control factor <ref target="#BIB27">[27]</ref>. The presence of the enzyme in the intestinal mucosa
                    is of a great interest, since the enterocytes play an active part in protein metabolism.</p>
               <p>In the present study, we describe an improved procedure for purifying milligram quantities of acylpeptide hydrolase to homogeneity, as well as further characterizing of the
                    enzyme from porcine intestinal mucosa and molecular cloning of the corresponding cDNA.</p>

                        mucosa was very similar to that deduced from the cDNA nucleotide sequence of both the rat <ref target="#BIB23">[23]</ref> and pig liver <ref target="#BIB24">[24]</ref> enzymes, except for Trp, Pro and Met. The total number of amino acids in the pig intestinal APH turned out however to be substantially
                        smaller than in the rat and pig liver enzymes (689 versus 732). No phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid was detected using the automatic Edman degradation procedure. This strongly
                        suggests that the NH<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>-terminal amino acid of the protein was probably blocked.</p>
                  <p>The homogeneity of APH was examined by performing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both nondenaturing and denaturing conditions. In the absence of SDS
                            (<ref target="#FIG1">Fig. 1A</ref>
                     <ptr target="#FIG1"/>), a single Coomassie blue-stained band was observed. As shown in <ref target="#FIG1">Fig. 1B</ref>, the relative molecular mass of the purified protein as determined by SDS–PAGE was 75±2 kDa, while the native enzyme had a
                        molecular mass of 280 kDa, as determined by gel filtration (data not shown). All in all, these data strongly suggested that pig intestinal APH is probably composed of four
                        identical subunits. The possible presence of any carbohydrate in the purified enzyme could definitely be ruled out, since both the Schiff reaction performed on the protein

                  <head>Effects of pH on enzyme activity</head>
                  <p>The pH dependence of the pig intestinal APH activity was measured at 37°C and at pH values ranging from 5 to 9.5, using 50 mM of potassium phosphate, glycine and
                        Tris–HCl buffers (data not shown). The optimal pH value was 8 in the case of the potassium phosphate and Tris–HCl buffers, and 9 in that of the glycine buffer. It
                        is worth mentioning here that the enzyme activity occurring in potassium phosphate and glycine buffers at pH 7 was only one-third of that recorded in the Tris–HCl

                        found to induce a twofold increase in the enzyme activity, at all the ionic strengths tested (data not shown).</p>

                        a function of the peptide length (about 200 to 50 nmol/min per μg enzyme). In all the experiments, the reaction products, which were identified by HPLC, consisted on the
                        one hand of Ac-Ala, and on the other hand of Ala, (Ala)<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> and (Ala)<hi rend="subscript">3</hi>, depending on the initial peptide substrate. Both
                            Ac-(Ala)<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> and Ac-(Ala)<hi rend="subscript">3</hi> were found to be better substrates than the usual APH synthetic substrate (AANA), since their

                  <p>Several protease inhibitors were tested in order to investigate which amino acid residues in the enzyme might play a catalytic role (<ref target="#TBL4">Table
                            4</ref>
                     <ptr target="#TBL4"/>). The enzyme was completely inactivated by 0.1 mM DFP, whereas the inhibition was as low as 12.5% with 1 mM PMSF, probably
                        because the latter is less soluble in aqueous buffers than the former. Benzamidine, the synthetic inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteases, which was used as a ligand for the
                        affinity chromatography during the purification of pig intestinal APH, was actually devoid of any inhibitory effects up to a concentration of 100 mM. It was therefore concluded
                        that APH possesses an interaction site for benzamidine, which was obviously not located at its catalytic site. DEPC, a histidine modifying reagent, inhibited APH at a
                        concentration as low as 1 mM. Sulfhydryl-reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol and DTT at quite a high concentration (10 mM) did not affect the specific enzyme activity. A
                        possible stabilizing effect was even observed in the presence of 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Since the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent (IAA) partly inhibited APH at 10 mM, cysteine
                        residues might be involved in the stabilization of the enzyme, probably via disulfide bonds.</p>
                  <p>Chelating agents such as EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline did not affect the enzyme activity, and surprisingly enough, a 20% activation of the enzyme occurred with 1 mM

                  <p>Porcine intestine APH was cloned by PCR using internal primers based on the sequence of porcine liver APH <ref target="#BIB23">[23]</ref>. The sequence

               <p>In this study, we describe an improved procedure for purifying from porcine intestinal mucosa the <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-acylpeptide hydrolase which releases the
                        <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-acetylamino acid from acetylated peptides. The molecular mass of this tetrameric enzyme was estimated to be 280 kDa,which is quite similar to the
                    values reported elsewhere on material from other sources, including rat and human tissues <ref target="#BIB11 #BIB15 #BIB20 #BIB35">[11,15,20,35]</ref>. The purified
                    APH was apparently not glycosylated, and its specific activity on the usual synthetic substrate AANA was fourfold to sixfold higher than those measured with the rat liver enzyme
                        <ref target="#BIB35">[35]</ref> as well as with both the human placenta and erythrocyte enzymes <ref target="#BIB15 #BIB18">[15,18]</ref>. When
                    the porcine intestinal enzyme, which was purified in the present study, was compared with both the rat and pig liver enzymes <ref target="#BIB23 #BIB24">[23,24]</ref>, the former APH was found to exhibit the same structural properties, i.e., the same subunit composition and N-terminal blocked residue.</p>
               <p>Although the enzyme has been found to be catalytically efficient on a variety of acetylated peptides, acetylalanyl peptides have been described as being the best substrates.
                    Some discrepancies exist among the results published so far on the enzyme’s affinity and its rate of hydrolysis as a function of the peptide chain lengths. In the present
                    study, the <hi rend="italic">V</hi>
                  <hi rend="subscript">max</hi> values obtained with pig intestinal APH decreased from 201 to 52 nmol/min per μg enzyme as the number of alanyl
                    residues increased from two to four, as compared with 107 to 269 nmol/min per μg enzyme in the case of the rat liver enzyme <ref target="#BIB35">[35]</ref>.
                    Our results are consistent with the existence of some steric hindrance of the active site, whereas the acylpeptide hydrolase from other sources has been found to exhibit the
                    highest rate of hydrolysis with Ac-Ala tripeptide <ref target="#BIB11 #BIB15 #BIB35 #BIB36 #BIB37">[11,15,35–37]</ref>. The
                        <hi rend="italic">K</hi>
                  <hi rend="subscript">m</hi> values we recorded with the acetylated alanyl peptides are comparable however to those obtained previously on both the rat liver
                        <ref target="#BIB24">[24]</ref> and human erythrocyte <ref target="#BIB36">[36]</ref> enzymes. APH did not cleave
                        Ac-<hi rend="smallCaps">l</hi>-Ala or Ac-<hi rend="smallCaps">d</hi>-Ala. These acetylated amino acids were nevertheless able to tightly bind to the enzyme and act as
                    strong inhibitors, especially Ac-<hi rend="smallCaps">l</hi>-Ala. The enzyme was found to exhibit a competitive inhibition toward the <hi rend="smallCaps">l</hi>-amino
                    acid, as in the rat liver <ref target="#BIB24">[24]</ref>, and the calculated <hi rend="italic">K</hi>
                  <hi rend="subscript">i</hi> values were similar in both cases (0.4 and
                    1.5 mM). Ac-<hi rend="smallCaps">l</hi>-Ala has also been reported to competitively inhibit the human erythrocyte enzyme <ref target="#BIB38">[38]</ref>.</p>
               <p>With the active site reagents such as DFP or DEPC, our results were in line with those published by Kobayashi and Smith <ref target="#BIB24">[24]</ref> on rat
                    liver APH. One or several cysteinyl residues were found to be probably necessary to stabilize the active enzyme conformation, as suggested by the data obtained in the inhibition
                    experiments with sulfhydryl-modifying agents. Scaloni et al. <ref target="#BIB39">[39]</ref> have shown that APH contains three disulfide bridges per monomer and
                    suggested that Cys-30 and/or Cys-64, which are located near the active site, might be involved in stability of catalytic site. It has been recently shown <ref target="#BIB25">[25]</ref> that the amino acid sequence around the active site of the acylpeptide hydrolase of human erythrocytes is identical to the consensus sequence
                    found to exist in mammalian serine proteases and esterases, namely Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly. The latter authors suggested that the active site of the APH may be similar to a member of the
                    prolyl endopeptidase family which was recently described in porcine brain <ref target="#BIB40">[40]</ref>. Our results are in good agreement with the fact that
                    intestinal acylpeptide hydrolase is a serine protease involving serine and histidine at its active site.</p>
               <p>The 2377-nucleotide long cDNA isolated in this study encoded a 731-amino-acid protein. Except for a single nucleotide difference, the cDNA sequence coding for the intestinal
                    APH was identical to that reported by Mitta et al. <ref target="#BIB23">[23]</ref> for the liver enzyme. This difference could be due to an allelic variation or to
                    some PCR artifact. Whatever the case, the results from sequence analysis definitely show that the same gene is coding for both porcine liver and intestinal APH.</p>
               <p>The exact physiological role of this enzyme in the intestine still remains to be elucidated. It might be involved in the intracellular protein turnover <ref target="#BIB11 #BIB35">[11,35]</ref>. The results of the present study also suggest that APH might be involved in the final steps of digestion of the
                        <hi rend="italic">N</hi>-acetylated peptides released by the combined action of endo- and exopeptidases in the intestinal lumen which are able to pass through the enterocyte
                    apical membrane <ref target="#BIB41">[41]</ref>. The acetylated amino acid which is released by APH may furthermore be hydrolyzed by an acylase, giving acetate and
                    a free amino acid which may then be utilized for protein synthesis. The existence of acylase has already been described in several tissues, and especially in the porcine intestine
                        <ref target="#BIB42">[42]</ref>. Moreover, very low levels of both APH and acylase I, and even no enzyme activity at all, have been observed in small cell lung
                    cancer <ref target="#BIB27">[27]</ref>. This observation suggests that the inactivation of these enzymes could lead to some accumulation of N-terminally acylated
                    growth factors which are normally involved in the cell physiology. Both substrate specificity and cellular localization studies are under way with a view to specifying the
                    potential role of this enzyme in the intestinal mucosa.</p>

            <p>Acetylation of hemoglobin by aspirin and other acetylating agents has been used to generate hemoglobin analogs with altered structural and functional properties, and
                    may prove useful in the treatment of sickle cell disease. We have studied the acetylation of human hemoglobin using [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]acetylsalicylic acid in
                    combination with two-dimensional HMQC and HSQC NMR analysis. The spectra of the acetylated hemoglobin exhibit a number of well resolved resonances. Several spectral assignment
                    strategies were used: blocking the 2,3-DPG binding site non-covalently with inositol hexaphosphate or covalently with a cross-linking agent, selective carbamylation of the
                    N-terminal valine amino groups with cyanate, spin-labeling the hemoglobin at βCys93, and analysis of a hemoglobin triple mutant: βV1MH2ΔK144R, in which
                    βLys144 is replaced by an arginine residue. These studies support the conclusion that the most rapidly acetylated residue is βLys82 rather than βLys144, as
                    previously reported. Further, it is apparent that acetyl βLys82 can give rise to several resonances due to additional acetylation of βLys82′ or other nearby
                    residues. An additional assignment strategy involving comparison of the chemical shifts of the acetyl resonances observed for adducts of diamagnetic carbonmonoxyhemoglobin with the
                    shifts observed in paramagnetic cyanomethemoglobin provides information about the location of the acetyl derivatives relative to the heme irons. This approach is limited, however,
                    by the lack of well defined structural information for the lysine residues on the protein surface. Additional tentative assignments have also been made, using the above
                    approaches.</p>

               <p>Studies of the chemical modification of hemoglobin have been performed for physiological, biochemical and pharmacological reasons. Cross-linked hemoglobin analogs with greater
                    stability are of potential use as blood substitutes <ref target="#BIB1 #BIB2 #BIB3 #BIB4">[1–4]</ref>; ‘double-headed aspirin’ molecules have
                    been among the most useful agents for stabilizing hemoglobin tetramers (<ref target="#BIB2">[2]</ref>, and references therein). Pharmacological agents which modify
                    sickle hemoglobin (HbS) can alter the aggregation behavior which is important in the pathology of sickle cell disease <ref target="#BIB5">[5]</ref>. Acetylsalicylic
                    acid (Aspirin) was one of the earliest agents to show promise for the treatment of sickle cell disease, based on its effects on HbS polymerization. Hence, an understanding of the
                    residue selectivity of aspirin modification and of the effects of acetylation on protein structure is central to the development of more useful agents. Indeed, several recently
                    proposed anti-sickling agents also act to acetylate hemoglobin, so that the analysis of acetylated Hb derivatives continues to be pertinent to the development of new therapeutic
                    agents for the treatment of sickle cell disease (<ref target="#BIB6">[6]</ref>, and references therein).</p>
               <p>Acetylation of proteins such as hemoglobin leads to a combination of relatively transient derivatives of tyrosine and histidine residues <ref target="#BIB7 #BIB8">[7,8]</ref> as well as more stable amide linkages formed with lysine side chains and N-terminal amino groups. Hemoglobin has 12 amino groups per chain, corresponding
                    to 11 lysine residues and an N-terminal valine. Thus, in theory there are 48 potential amino modification sites, with only 24 of these sites being structurally inequivalent. Among
                    these residues, βVal1, βLys82, βLys144 are located approximately 5–21 Å apart in the cationic β cleft. Several surface lysine residues
                    including βLys59, βLys65, αLys11, αLys61, and αLys90 are surrounded by nearby lysine and histidine residues. In theory, these residues are likely
                    to be sites of significant acetylation. Using conventional protein chemistry techniques to study the modification reaction, Klotz and co-workers <ref target="#BIB9">[9]</ref> concluded that the primary aspirin acetylation sites are βLys144, βLys59, and αLys90. βLys144 is located within the vicinity of
                    the hemoglobin β-cleft, the region directly involved in the binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), a modulator of hemoglobin oxygen binding affinity.
                    Aspirin-acetylated hemoglobin was found to possess slightly increased oxygen affinity <ref target="#BIB10 #BIB11">[10,11]</ref>. Other studies suggest a lower
                    specificity of acetylation by aspirin <ref target="#BIB11">[11]</ref>. A series of ‘double-headed’ aspirin analogs including bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl)
                    fumarate (BDSF) have been reported to cross-link hemoglobin either by reacting with the two βLys82 groups of oxyhemoglobin (OxyHbA) <ref target="#BIB1 #BIB2">[1,2]</ref>, or the two αLys99 residues of deoxyhemoglobin <ref target="#BIB3">[3]</ref>. In comparison with the unmodified hemoglobin,
                    βLys82-βLys82′ cross-linked hemoglobin is characterized by increased oxygen affinity <ref target="#BIB1 #BIB2">[1,2]</ref>, whereas the
                    αLys99-αLys99′ cross-linked stable hemoglobin tetramer shows a lower oxygen affinity <ref target="#BIB3">[3]</ref>. The difference in residue
                    selectivity between the bifunctional and monofunctional aspirin analogs was proposed to be primarily due to the favorable orientation of the fumarate or succinate linkers, which
                    enable the bifunctional analogs to bridge the two βLys82 or the two αLys99 residues of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, respectively. More recently, methyl acetyl phosphate
                    (MAP), an inhibitor originally designed to target <hi rend="smallCaps">d</hi>-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase <ref target="#BIB12">[12]</ref>, was shown to be
                    a potent acetylating agent for hemoglobin, targeting primarily βVal1, βLys82 and βLys144 and to a smaller degree, αLys99, resulting in increased oxygen
                    affinity and greater solubility of HbS (<ref target="#BIB6">[6]</ref>, and references therein). The variability of acetylation sites among several aspirin analogs
                    and MAP, and the presence of minor acetylation adducts of aspirin <ref target="#BIB11">[11]</ref>, and the increasingly diverse therapeutic applications of aspirin
                    as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) agent, support the need to revisit the residue selectivity of aspirin acetylation.</p>
               <p>Modern two-dimensional NMR methods offer the possibility of resolving the resonances corresponding to many of the individual adduct sites with relatively high sensitivity if
                    the acetyl group contains a stable isotope label <ref target="#BIB13">[13]</ref>. Furthermore, once an acetylation resonance is assigned to a particular residue,
                    the acetylation of this residue by other agents can be readily studied without the need for extensive assignment work. The resonances of many adducts can be resolved in a single
                    spectrum, without the need for the separation of globin chains and digestion of hemoglobin adducts. The reaction kinetics of various sites can also be followed simultaneously in
                    real time. Finally, information on the structural perturbation and dynamic changes of hemoglobin resulting from chemical modification can also be obtained. In contrast,
                    characterization of the sites of chemical modification by conventional protein chemistry techniques often requires multiple steps of isolation and purification of the modified
                    radio-labeled hemoglobin adducts and their enzyme digested products, amino acid analysis by methods such as Edman degradation, and peptide mapping. Such an approach is, in general,
                    tedious and often results in the loss of trace amounts of protein adducts or loss of modified sites if the bond is too weak. In the present study, we report our NMR investigation
                    into the selectivity and extent of acetylation of human hemoglobin A by [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]acetyl salicylic acid ([1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA).</p>

                  <p>Human carbonmonoxyhemoglobin (COHbA) was separated using a procedure similar to that reported earlier <ref target="#BIB14">[14]</ref>. Human blood from

                        ratio of red cell suspension:H<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>O:ether=3:3:1), followed by sufficient mixing to extract hemoglobin. The hemoglobin-containing aqueous phase was collected, and
                        filtered through a Whatman number one paper filter. The residual ether was then removed by rotary evaporation prior to dialysis in PBK. The hemoglobin solution was
                        reconcentrated to 2–3 mM using the Centricon or Centriprep nitrocellulose membrane filters. Unless otherwise stated, COHbA was used for the acetylation study. The CO
                        form of hemoglobin was selected because it is more stable than oxyHbA, thereby avoiding paramagnetic contributions arising from any deoxyhemoglobin which might form, as well as
                        oxidation of the protein during long spectral acquisition periods. Under the present conditions, no significant shift of the absorption frequency was found in acetyl COHbA,
                        thus suggesting insignificant oxidation of hemoglobin. For preparation of acetylated cyanomethemoglobin A (CNHbA), COHbA (2.5 mM) was reacted with Drabkin’s reagent (1
                        ml COHbA: 250 ml Drabkin’s reagent, Sigma), at 25°C for ∼120 min; this extended reaction time was needed to ensure the complete oxidation of COHbA to
                        CNHbA. The CNHbA solution was then concentrated prior to being treated with [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA. Hemoglobin concentration was routinely determined by measuring

                  <p>To identify the adduct resonances of the more readily acetylated residues, and to establish the conditions for maximum adduct formation, COHbA was reacted with
                            [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA for 1, 3, 6 and 12 h, and adduct formation was followed by obtaining HMQC spectra of the adducts collected at these times (<ref target="#FIG1">Fig. 1</ref>

                        studies of aspirin acetylation were performed with the [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA. These spectra exhibit many well resolved adduct resonances, thus permitting the
                        assessment of the relative selectivity of the aspirin acetylation reaction. Typically, after a 12 h reaction period, at least 10 resolved peaks could be distinguished, although
                        in general, additional smaller and more variable peaks can be observed in the spectra.</p>

                        corresponds to the acetate carbonyl resonance as a result of folding the resonance at 182.14 ppm (<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C value) into the region of interest. The use of a smaller
                        spectral window which resulted in the folding of the acetate resonance allowed improved spectral resolution. We note that despite the long period of dialysis, some residual
                        acetate was typically present in the sample. This may reflect some binding of the acetate to the hemoglobin, or the decomposition of labile adducts which can be formed with
                        tyrosyl or histidyl residues.</p>
                  <p>Hydroxyl and amino groups as well as the ring nitrogens of histidines can all be subject to acetylation <ref target="#BIB7 #BIB19 #BIB20 #BIB21">[7,19–21]</ref>. However, the serine hydroxyl groups are considerably less reactive, and the acetylated adducts of tyrosine and histidine are generally
                        significantly less stable. As noted in recent studies of acetylated ubiquitin <ref target="#BIB13">[13]</ref>, adducts formed with amino groups can be
                        identified on the basis of deuterium isotope shifts of the acetamide resonances which are most easily observed in 50/50 H<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>O/D<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>O solution. We
                        observed these shifts in the <hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C dimension (<hi rend="italic">δ</hi>∼0.09 ppm, spectra not shown here) for most of the hemoglobin adduct
                        resonances, and in the remaining cases, the observation of clear isotope shifts was limited by the congestion in some regions of the spectra or by poor signal/noise for some of
                        the weaker resonances.</p>
                  <p>Since human hemoglobin A contains 24 inequivalent α- and ϵ-amino groups, at very low levels of modification at which only approximately one residue/molecule
                        is acetylated, in theory a maximum of 24 distinct resonances would be anticipated. Similarly, fully acetylated hemoglobin would also be expected to exhibit 24 distinct
                        resonances. However, at intermediate levels of modification, a distribution of acetylated species exists which could in principle lead to additional resonances. This is
                        particularly true for residues which are close in space such as βLys82 and βLys82′ in the 2,3-DPG binding cleft, so that the acetylation of one lysine
                        residue could perturb the chemical shift of the neighboring acetyl lysine. In other words, two resonances are expected for an individual lysyl residue if a nearby second
                        residue is partially modified. Thus, acetylation of two closely spaced lysine residues could in principle lead to four resonances corresponding to the two singly acetylated
                        residues and to the doubly acetylated species. In the case of two corresponding residues on different chains close enough to affect each other’s chemical shift, such as
                        βLys82 and βLys82′, there would be two possible resonances corresponding to hemoglobin singly or doubly modified at βLys82. This effect is most
                        likely to be significant for residues located in the β-cleft, since these lysines have a relatively high probability of modification, and since the proximity of amino
                        groups from the two β chains might be expected to lead to interactions among the modified residues.</p>
                  <p>Analysis of the time dependence of the peak volumes, summarized in <ref target="#FIG2">Fig. 2</ref>
                     <ptr target="#FIG2"/>, provides evidence for
                        the type of shift perturbation noted above. Data for eight of the resonances were quantified in this way. Although the three major adduct resonances 1, 3, and 6 continued to
                        increase in intensity over the entire 12 h period of acetylation, the apparent rate of modification for peak 6 declined significantly as the experiment progressed. In contrast,
                        the other significantly modified residues giving rise to peaks 1 and 3 show a more consistent rate of increase. The remaining resonances show some variation, although the lower
                        signal/noise of these peaks makes quantitation more difficult. One possible explanation for the decrease in the rate of modification of the residue corresponding to peak 6 is a
                        time-dependent decrease in pH. Despite substantial buffering of the solution (∼35 mM phosphate, pH 7), there was typically a drop of ∼0.5 pH units during the
                        course of the experiment, which would be expected to lower the acetylation rate. However, this drop in pH does not appear to perturb substantially the rate of modification of
                        peaks 1 or 3. Alternatively, if as discussed above the modification of a nearby residue(s) can lead to multiple peaks from a single modified residue, then the intensity of
                        resonances formed at early times will be expected to level off and ultimately to decrease. The total intensity of all adduct resonances corresponding to a particular residue
                        will, however, continue to increase. The rapid initial acetylation leading to resonance 6 may thus continue, with the intensity of the modified lysine resonance distributed
                        among two or more separate resonances. The best candidate for such a second resonance is peak 9. In particular, studies of the chemical shifts observed in the oxidized CNHbA
                        show that resonances 6 and 9 are subject to identical paramagnetic shifts, and therefore appear to have identical orientations relative to the heme irons. Thus, we hypothesize
                        that resonance 6 corresponds to the initial acetylation of a particular residue, and resonance 9 to the same residue in multiply acetylated hemoglobin. This observation is
                        consistent with the kinetic data shown in <ref target="#FIG2">Fig. 2</ref>. Resonance 5, which also shows a similar, although not identical shift, may also
                        correspond to the same acetyllysine residue, in yet another multiply acetylated form.</p>

                     <hi rend="subscript">D</hi> value given above, these concentrations should be sufficient to saturate
                        96.8% and 98.8% of the 2,3-DPG binding sites, respectively, assuming a 1:1 binding ratio of IHP binding to hemoglobin and negligible association with other sites on the
                        hemoglobin. In the presence of IHP, the HMQC spectra of the acetylated COHbA (<ref target="#FIG3">Fig. 3</ref>
                     <ptr target="#FIG3"/>) exhibit a
                        substantial reduction in the intensities of resonances 6, 8, and 9. At an IHP:COHbA ratio of 2.5:1, the intensity losses for resonances 6, 8, and 9 were approximately 67, 81,
                        and 77%, respectively. In addition, the intensities of peaks 3 and 5 also decrease, but to a smaller degree. The intensities of the remaining resonances did not appear to be
                        significantly reduced. At IHP concentrations ≥5 mM (IHP:COHbA=5:1), we began to observe an apparent general decrease of resonance intensities presumably resulting from
                        non-specific protection of all of the amino groups. Hence, the highly anionic IHP molecule apparently exhibits some affinity for other accessible amino groups. The greater
                        decrease of spectral intensity of peaks 6, 8 and 9 in the presence of IHP indicates that the corresponding residues are situated in the β-cleft, in agreement with the

                        ratios ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 were allowed to react at 37°C for 2 h followed by extensive dialysis to remove unreacted BDSF, prior to acetylation by
                            [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA. HMQC spectra for acetylated COHbA pre-treated at a 1:1 BDSF:OxyHbA ratio are shown in <ref target="#FIG4">Fig.
                            4</ref>
                     <ptr target="#FIG4"/>. In general, all of the acetyl resonances are attenuated to some extent. However, BDSF appeared to produce the greatest
                        protection against aspirin acetylation for residues corresponding to peaks 5, 6, and 9. A significant protective effect is also apparent for peak 8, although, given that this
                        resonance is relatively weak initially, the change is less significant. The major protective effect of BDSF was somewhat unexpected, since previous studies have indicated that
                        aspirin targets primarily βLys144, βlys59 and αLys90 <ref target="#BIB9">[9]</ref>, while BDSF targets primarily βLys82 of oxyHbA.
                        Yet, both IHP binding and BDSF pre-modification appear to dramatically reduce the same group of resonances: peaks 5, 6, and 9, with a somewhat weaker targeting of resonance 8.
                        Since the characterization of the cross-linked hemoglobin is more extensive <ref target="#BIB1 #BIB3">[1,3]</ref>, these data lead to the tentative proposal
                        that peaks 5, 6, and 9 which, as discussed below appear to correspond to a single residue in multiply acetylated hemoglobin, most likely arise from acetyl βLys82, while
                        the less significantly protected resonance 8, which also corresponds to a residue in the DPG binding site, would arise from acetyl βLys144. This protection of
                        βLys144 from aspirin acetylation could reflect protection resulting from formation of a fumarate adduct with βLys144, or a general reduced accessibility of
                        residues in the β-cleft region in the βLys82-βLys82′ cross-linked hemoglobin, and/or the reduced charge of the β-cleft in the cross-linked
                        hemoglobin.</p>

                  <p>In order to evaluate further the proposal that resonances 5, 6, and 9 correspond to acetyl βLys82, while resonance 8 corresponds to acetyl βLys144, studies
                        utilizing the spin label 3-(2-iodoacetamido)-proxyl were performed. The βCys93 residues of hemoglobin have been shown to possess high reactivity toward reactive
                        halogenated molecules <ref target="#BIB23 #BIB24 #BIB25">[23–25]</ref>, and this has served as the basis for the preparation of hemoglobin selectively
                        spin-labeled at this residue <ref target="#BIB26 #BIB27">[26,27]</ref>. Analysis of the crystal structure of COHbA (PDB # 1BBB <ref target="#BIB28">[28]</ref>) indicates that the side-chain amino groups of βLys144 and βLys82 are 6.5–6.9 Å and 12.9–15.4 Å,
                        respectively, from the βCys93 sulfur atom. Hence, introduction of a spin label at this position should dramatically broaden the acetyl βLys144 resonance, and
                        depending on the orientation of the spin label, might also be anticipated to have some broadening effect on the acetyl βLys82 adduct resonance as well. In the

We obtained a small amount of a human hemoglobin mutant containing three β chain mutations: Val1→Met1, His2 deletion,
                        Lys144→Arg144 (βV1MH2ΔK144R). This mutant, which has previously been studied by vibrational spectroscopy <ref target="#BIB32">[32]</ref>,
                        although possessing the desired β chain K144R mutation which would allow assignment of the acetylated K144 resonance, is characterized by two additional modifications of
                        the β cleft which may also alter 2,3-DPG binding and could lead to additional shift perturbations. Since only a small amount of this hemoglobin mutant was available, it
                        was only possible to perform a single study at a much lower concentration (0.23 mM) than used for the remaining studies (typically 1–2 mM). Since there is a small
                        tendency of acetylated hemoglobin to precipitate over the extended period of the NMR experiment at 37°C, the studies were performed at a lower temperature (25°C)
                        for the βV1MH2ΔK144R mutant which had been acetylated with [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA for a 12 h period (<ref target="#FIG6">Fig.

                        Resonances labeled 1m, 3m, 6m, and 7m are assigned to the corresponding peaks 1, 3, 6, and 7 in the acetylated COHbA, while there is no resonance in the mutant which
                        corresponds closely to resonance 8 in the COHbA. The disappearance of resonance 8 is consistent with identification of this peak with acetyl βLys144. Resonance 6m, which
                        may be subject to a small shift perturbation, approximately 0.01 ppm upfield <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>H shift relative to resonance 6 in the acetylated COHbA, is nevertheless present
                        in the mutant, and so can be assigned to βLys82, consistent with the above data derived from IHP and BDSF protection, and proximity to spin-labeled

                     <hi rend="subscript">a</hi> for isocyanic acid is ∼3.8 <ref target="#BIB34">[34]</ref>. Cyanate has been reported to carbamylate αVal1 and βVal1 with a rate approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the
                        carbamylation of the ϵ-NH<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> of lysine residues <ref target="#BIB35">[35]</ref>, consistent with the difference in
                            p<hi rend="italic">K</hi> values. However, aspirin has not been reported to acetylate either of the N-terminal valine amino groups, even though βVal1 is one of the
                        residues of the β-cleft near the reported major acetylation site (βLys144). In this study, the possibility of a selective protective effect on the N-terminal
                        valine residues by carbamylation was explored. Hemoglobin was carbamylated with varying concentrations of sodium cyanate for a period of 3 h prior to the incubation with
                            [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA at 37°C. Although many of the acetyl resonances exhibit significant reductions in intensity (spectra not shown), the relative
                        differences in protection were not sufficiently pronounced to allow assignment of any of the resonances to α or β N-terminal valine adducts. In fact, as discussed
                        below, the valine residues are apparently more accessible to the cyanate molecule than to the larger aspirin molecule. These results suggest that the α and βVal1
                        residues are unlikely to be among the amino groups highly acetylated by aspirin.</p>

                  <head>Pseudo-contact shifts in cyanomethemoglobin</head>
                  <p>One potential approach for the assignment of adducts in hemoglobin involves the use of the through space dipolar or ‘pseudo-contact’ shifts produced by the
                        heme. Following this approach, we assume that the diamagnetic COHbA and the paramagnetic CNHbA are isostructural. This approximation, which has often been made in studies of
                        myoglobin <ref target="#BIB36">[36]</ref>, is most reasonable for residues which are relatively far from the heme group, as expected for most of the modified
                        lysines. We make the further assumptions that the acetyl groups introduced are all relatively far from the heme iron, in general, &gt;10 Å, and, in the absence of more
                        detailed structural information, we use the lysine Nϵ position as an approximation for the positions of both the acetyl carbonyl and methyl nuclei (<ref target="#FIG7">Fig. 7</ref>
                     <ptr target="#FIG7"/>), i.e.

                        Thus, on the basis of these assumptions, it is predicted that the shift differences of the peaks in the HMQC spectra of COHbA and CNHbA will exhibit a slope of 1, i.e. the
                        dipolar shifts in ppm for the carbonyl carbon and the methyl protons will be approximately the same.</p>
                  <p>The validity of the assumptions used in the analysis of the pseudo-contact shifts is most clearly demonstrated by a comparison of HMQC spectra for COHbA and CNHbA which
                        have been exposed to the [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA for a relatively short period (2 h at 37°C), so that only three major adduct resonances are significant

                     <ptr target="#FIG8"/>). The HMQC spectra of the acetylated CNHbA showed significant changes of the chemical shift
                        dispersion of the adduct resonances with respect to the acetylated COHbA control. As can be seen from this figure, the slopes
                            (Δ<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C/Δ<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>H) for the three major acetyl groups are all similar and close to 1 (<ref target="#TBL1">Table

                     <hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C)=(2.05,174.59) in the CNHbA spectrum is unassigned.</p>
                  <p>For the analysis of the pseudo-contact shifts of acetylated CNHbA, there appear to be no available data on the orientation of the heme g-tensors in hemoglobin, so we have
                        treated the four hemes independently based on the reported myoglobin studies <ref target="#BIB36 #BIB37">[36,37]</ref>, which indicate that the g-tensor of
                        myoglobin exhibits rhombic symmetry. The axial component lies approximately along the FeCO tilt axis in the isostructural COHbA complex, while the rhombic magnetic axes align
                        closely with the projection of the proximal histidine imidazole plane onto the heme. There are several approaches which can be used to predict the shifts. Based on the above
                        g-tensor, we have calculated the polar angle <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> as the angle defined by the C(O)-Fe-Lys-Nϵ atoms, and the azimuthal angle
                            <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> as the angle defined by His-Cδ-His-Nϵ-Fe-Lys-Nϵ. Based on the assumption of a planar imidazole ring, the His-Cϵ
                        could also be used for the calculation which as given below, has a cos 2<hi rend="italic">φ</hi> dependence. This procedure effectively projects the rhombal
                            <hi rend="italic">x</hi>-axis onto the <hi rend="italic">x</hi>-<hi rend="italic">y</hi> plane after, rather than before, the rotation of the <hi rend="italic">z</hi>-axis,
                        a distinction which we believe to be inconsequential in terms of the available information on the g-tensor and the present level of approximation. As discussed by Emerson and
                        La Mar <ref target="#BIB36">[36]</ref>, the pseudo-contact or dipolar shift is then given by:<formula>

                  <p>Chemical shifts have been normalized relative to the larger downfield shift for resonance 6 which, as discussed above, is tentatively assigned to acetyl βLys82 on
                        the basis of studies with BDSF, spin-labeled hemoglobin, and acetylation of a triply mutated hemoglobin. Resonances 1 and 3 have been assigned to acetyl βLys59 and
                        acetyl αLys90, respectively, on the basis of the studies of Shamsuddin et al. <ref target="#BIB9">[9]</ref>, the lack of protective effect of IHP or BDSF
                        which block modification at 2,3-DPG binding site, and the signs of their predicted paramagnetic shifts in CNHbA. Setting the paramagnetic shift of peak 6 equal to 1.0, and
                        assigning this peak to acetyl βLys82, leads to relative predicted paramagnetic shifts for βLys82, βLys59 and αLys90 of 1.0, 0.46, and −0.48,
                        respectively (<ref target="#TBL2">Table 2</ref>
                     <ptr target="#TBL2"/>). These values compare with relative measured shifts for peaks 6, 1, and 3 of
                        1.0, 0.49, and −0.61, respectively. Given the variation in the calculated shifts for the individual lysine residues (<ref target="#TBL2">Table 2</ref>),
                        this agreement must be considered fortuitous. Further, the there appear to be no resonances exhibiting the large predicted downfield shift of 3.28 ppm predicted for acetyl
                        βLys144, which according to Shamsuddin et al. <ref target="#BIB9">[9]</ref> is among the most heavily acetylated lysine residues in hemoglobin. The
                        variation in the predicted shifts between corresponding lysyl residues on identical chains, shown in <ref target="#TBL2">Table 2</ref>, results from the large
                        variations in the orientation of the lysine residues located on the surface of the protein in the crystal structure <ref target="#BIB28">[28]</ref>. For
                        example, the distance of αLys90 Nϵ from the heme iron is 13.28 Å on the α (A) chain, but only 9.76 Å on the other α (C) chain. As
                        noted below, large αA/αC and βB/βD variations in the calculated surface accessibility of the pairs of equivalent lysine Nϵ groups are also
                        derived from the crystal structure data. This appears to be the most significant limitation on the application of this technique to the prediction of paramagnetic shifts of
                        protein adducts.</p>
                  <p>Other sites which have been reported to be modified by aspirin or related analogs include βLys144, αLys99, and βVal1. The predicted shifts for
                        βLys144 and αLys99 shown in <ref target="#TBL2">Table 2</ref> are considerably larger than any observed. This result casts some doubt on the
                        identification of resonance 8 as corresponding to acetyl βLys144 although, as discussed above, the quantitative value of such predictions for residues located on the
                        surface of the protein is limited. The acetyl βVal1 resonance may correspond to one of the less heavily modified resonances such as peak 2 or 4.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the specific assignment information discussed above, it was particularly apparent from a comparison of the spectra obtained for COHbA and CNHbA after a 12 h
                        period of exposure to [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA that: peaks 6 and 9 shift as a group (spectrum not shown here), so that their relative positions are maintained in the
                        COHbA and CNHbA systems. This is not completely apparent from the data in <ref target="#TBL1">Table 1</ref> due to round-off errors in reporting the peak
                        positions. Peak 5 shows a similar, although not identical shift, and may also correspond to the same acetyl lysine residue in another polyacetylated analog. Although this
                        behavior could be coincidental, this similarity would result if all of the resonances in this group correspond to a single residue – βLys82, with the shift
                        variation reflecting differences in the degree of modification of nearby residues, presumably the second βLys82′, or possibly βLys144, or βVal1. The
                        residues in the β-cleft should be particularly susceptible to this type of effect, since there are a number of nearby cationic groups located in a relatively small
                        volume which defines the 2,3-DPG binding site. This result is also suggested by kinetic data outlined above (<ref target="#FIG2">Fig. 2</ref>).</p>

                  <head>Surface accessibility of hemoglobin amino groups</head>
                  <p>The surface accessibility of the amino groups of COHbA (PDB # 1BBB <ref target="#BIB28">[28]</ref>) estimated based on the contact areas of a probe of 3
                        Å radius determined using the Connolly algorithm in the program Insight II (Molecular Simulation, Inc., V97) is shown in <ref target="#FIG9">Fig.
                            9</ref>
                     <ptr target="#FIG9"/>. Accessibility data is given as a ratio relative to the accessibility of the ϵ-amino group of free lysine. The 3
                        Å radius yields a sphere with a diameter of 6 Å which roughly corresponds to the largest molecular dimension of aspirin (7.27 Å). In general, the use of
                        probe spheres with larger radii gives qualitatively analogous results. These calculations provide an explanation for the lack of a significant protective effect on acetylated
                        adduct resonances by cyanate. The αVal1 amino nitrogens are almost completely inaccessible to a 3 Å probe, and the βVal1 amino groups only slightly more
                        accessible. Thus, it is unlikely that there is significant acetylation of the Val1 amino groups by aspirin. Probably a smaller acetylating agent such as acetic anhydride would
                        modify these residues to a greater extent. It is also apparent that accessibility alone is not a good predictor of the residue susceptibility to modification under the
                        conditions of the study. The most highly modified residue, βLys82, is among the least accessible. Hence, binding to the cationic DPG bindite cleft is a more important
                        determinant of the degree of modification.</p>
                  <p>As is also apparent from <ref target="#FIG9">Fig. 9</ref>, there are large differences in accessibility for many of the residues between the two α
                        or two β chains. This variation is analogous with the variation in orientation of the lysine side chains relative to the hemes which limit the predictive value of the
                        paramagnetic dipolar shifts, as discussed above. The shallowness of the potential energy surfaces for the surface lysine residues and their resulting disorder limits the
                        predictive value of both the surface accessibility and the orientation-dependent shift calculations.</p>

               <head>Discussion</head>
               <p>Acylation of hemoglobin by aspirin and other acylating agents has been used to generate analogs with improved structural and functional properties (<ref target="#BIB1 #BIB10 #BIB38 #BIB39 #BIB40">[1,10,38–40]</ref> and references therein). Stable, cross-linked hemoglobin tetramers have potential as oxygen delivery
                    therapeutic agents <ref target="#BIB4">[4]</ref>. Among the bi-functional analogues, BDSF was shown to target primarily two βLys82 residues of oxyhemoglobin,
                    thus forming a cross-linked hemoglobin tetramer with increased oxygen affinity relative to native hemoglobin <ref target="#BIB1">[1]</ref>. The acetylation of human
                    hemoglobin by acetylsalicylic acid <ref target="#BIB9 #BIB10 #BIB11">[9–11]</ref> is a biochemical action unrelated to its principal therapeutic use as a
                    NSAID. The lack of sufficient residue selectivity has limited its use as an anti-sickling agent, despite the modest increase of oxygen affinity of aspirin-acetylated sickle
                    hemoglobin <ref target="#BIB10">[10]</ref>. Previous studies suggested a significant discrepancy between the target residues of aspirin and of bi-functional analogs
                    such as BDSF. Thus, the former agent was not reported to modify βLys82, while the latter cross-links hemoglobin at this residue. In the present studies, the combination of
                    data derived from the protection afforded by using a bifunctional acylation agent, BDSF, as a blocking agent for βLys82, spin-labeling βCys93 that is in proximity to
                    βLys144, and acetylation of a triple mutant hemoglobin analog all support the identity of βLys82 as the principal target of aspirin acetylation, rather than
                    βLys144, as previously reported <ref target="#BIB9">[9]</ref>. This result may also be considered qualitatively consistent with the analysis of paramagnetic,
                    dipolar shifts in cyanomethemoglobin, although the large variations in the positions of surface lysine residues limit the quantitative utility of this approach as an assignment
                    tool.</p>
               <p>Despite the size of the hemoglobin molecule, the HMQC spectra of hemoglobin acetylated with [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA are readily obtained at 1 mM concentrations,
                    even though the weak, two bond J-coupling interaction between the acetyl carbonyl carbon and the protons of the methyl group is used for these studies. The success of this approach
                    is presumably based on the fact that there is substantial mobility at the end of the long acetyl lysine chains, while local structural differences remain sufficient to provide
                    significant chemical shift dispersion. The mobility results in a lengthened <hi rend="italic">T</hi>
                  <hi rend="subscript">2</hi> value, allowing polarization transfer even using the weaker,
                    two-bond coupling interaction.</p>
               <p>Previous studies of protein modification have yielded data suggesting that individual modified residues might give rise to multiple resonances <ref target="#BIB13">[13]</ref>. This effect can arise because modification at additional, usually nearby sites can perturb the shift of the previously modified resonance. The present
                    studies provide strong support for this effect in hemoglobin. The strongly modified βLys82 residue yields an intense acetyl resonance, peak 6, after a short reaction period,
                    while after a longer reaction period this peak tends to remain fairly constant as other, nearby resonances appear. In paramagnetic CNHbA, this group of resonances appears to shift
                    as a unit, indicating nearly identical orientations relative to the paramagnetic heme irons. It is particularly reasonable for βLys82 to yield two resonances, with peak 6
                    corresponding to COHbA molecules containing a single acetyl βLys82 group, and peak 9 containing two acetyl βLys82 groups. The relatively high probability of
                    modification of this residue and the relatively close proximity of the two βLys82 sidechains support this interpretation. Indeed, if these resonances can be specifically
                    assigned to these modifications, then the ratio of COHbA containing double/single βLys82 modifications can be determined. However, the possible identity of peak 5 as also
                    arising from acetylated βLys82 limits further interpretation of these shifts at present.</p>
               <p>In summary, incubation of hemoglobin with [1′-<hi rend="superscript">13</hi>C]ASA indicates modification of many of the accessible lysine residues, with βLys82 the most
                    rapidly and highly acetylated. This residue is among the least accessible to a 3 Å spherical probe, so that modification must arise due to a specific binding interaction of
                    aspirin in the β-cleft. This conclusion is inconsistent with a previous study based on peptide analysis <ref target="#BIB9">[9]</ref>, but is supported by a
                    variety of strategies utilized here, including examination of a triple hemoglobin mutant. It is also consistent with previous studies indicating that ‘double-headed
                    aspirin’ cross-linking agents can link the pair of βLys82 residues in hemoglobin, although in principle, the cross-linking agents could exhibit different specificity
                    than aspirin. We have also found that as the molecule becomes more highly acetylated, single residues can correspond to multiple peaks due to additional modification of nearby
                    residues. This is most apparent for βLys82, which has a high susceptibility to acetylation and has neighboring residues, including βLys82′, which can also be
                    acetylated.</p>
